# Hey, I’m Lucas Balieiro

I build things in the open, mostly around **Bitcoin open-source** and I like learning by getting my hands dirty.

Right now I’m interested into:

* **Stratum V2** and low-level Bitcoin protocol design as consequence.

Outside of code, I enjoy classical music, Dire Straits guitar fantasies, and reading more books than I have time for (I’m *slowly* fixing that by giving some away).

If you’re into Bitcoin dev, open source, or just enjoy talking about obscure technical things, hit me up.
I’m usually not the smartest person in the room, but I like being aound when the smart ones start talking.

And listen…
If you accidentally bought *too much* Bitcoin (it happens to the best of us) and you’re thinking,
“Wow, I sure wish I could support a promising developer from a country the IMF likes to call ‘emerging’”…

Hi. Yes. Hello. **It’s me.** I accept donations, praise, and snacks.
